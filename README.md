THE PROBLEM:
1)Opening a new account in a bank usually requires a person to visit the bank, fill out a form, and submit the necessary papers. 
2)All of these tasks take up a lot of time and dampen the overall customer experience. 
3)Moreover, many people have to take time out of their schedules to go to a bank.

THE SOLUTION:

6)In order to run the project, we must have installed Python on our PC.

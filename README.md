THE PROBLEM:
1)Opening a new account in a bank usually requires a person to visit the bank, fill out a form, and submit the necessary papers. 
2)All of these tasks take up a lot of time and dampen the overall customer experience. 
3)Moreover, many people have to take time out of their schedules to go to a bank.

THE SOLUTION:
1)You can solve this problem by creating a software solution where people can sign up and open a new account in a bank digitally.
2)This way, the person wouldn’t have to visit the bank physically and thus, would save a lot of time and effort. 

INTRODUCTION:
1)more user friendliness in the various activities such as maintenance and searching.
2)entire information has been maintained in the database or Files and whoever wants to retrieve can’t retrieve, only authorization users can retrieve the necessary 
information which can easily be accessible from the file.

WORKING:
1)The user can register his/her account by providing details such as username, age, gender and password. After that the user has successfully registered. 
2)Now the user can login through their registered username and password. 
3)After login, the user can view their personal details as well as deposit and withdraw money. 
4)The user’s every detail including their current balance is stored in the file directory.  
5)In this way, the data is efficiently managed. 6. From this type of application, a user can simply manage his/her personal accounts with fewer efforts. 
6)In order to run the project, we must have installed Python on our PC.

BUILD STATUS:
The project is successfully build, compiled and executed.

TECH/FRAMEWORK USED:
